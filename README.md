In this repository we explore the ideas presented in the original work by Hargrove and Schmidt [1] and White, Brewer and Wilson [2] on the effect that changing the rate of synthesis and degradation of mRNA would have on the final concentration. We play with the simplest, well established mathematical model based on a single compartment, with zero-order rate kinetics for mRNA synthesis and first-order rate of decay. 

Included files aims at further supporting hypotheses generated by **Srimeenakshi Sankaranarayanan**, Carl Haag, Patrick Petzsch, Karl Köhrer, Kathi Zarnack and **Michael Feldbrügge** in their manuscript.
